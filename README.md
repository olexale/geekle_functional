# Demo app for Flutter Global Summit 21 Vol 2 talk by Oleksandr Leushchenko

This demo showcases a fake functional programming library usage. 

1. Go to the `slides` folder for slides and useful links.
2. In the `app_start` folder, you may see the initial state of the app. In the `app_end` - the final result.
3. `app_end` app contains slightly different implementations of service and cubit. In your apps you may use any variant, but my recommendation is to use `weather_service_2.dart`-like approach.
4. The app contains a macOS desktop application. If you want to run it on mobile or web - run `flutter create .` command in the root folder of the app to generate other platforms.
